## How to Release

💡 **Update CHANGELOG.md continuously with every meaningful change before committing!**

### Pre-Release Checklist

Before creating any release:

1. ✅ **Update CHANGELOG.md first**: Move all items from `[Unreleased]` to a new versioned section with today's date
2. ✅ **Verify tests pass**: Run `npm run coverage` - all tests must pass
3. ✅ **Build successfully**: Run `npm run build` - TypeScript must compile without errors
4. ✅ **Lint passes**: Run `npm run lint` - ESLint must pass with no warnings
5. ✅ **Update Swagger docs**: Run `npm run swagger:docs` if API endpoints changed
6. ✅ **Commit CHANGELOG**: Push the CHANGELOG update before tagging

### Creating a Release

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**

   Move items from `[Unreleased]` to a new version section:

   ```markdown
   ## [1.1.0 - bicyclekick] - YYYY-MM-DD
   ```

   Commit and push this change.

2. **Create and push tag**

   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.1.0-bicyclekick -m "Release 1.1.0 - Bicycle-kick"
   git push origin v1.1.0-bicyclekick
   ```

3. **CD pipeline runs automatically**

   GitHub Actions will:
   - Run full test suite with coverage
   - Build Docker image
   - Publish to GHCR with tags: `:1.1.0`, `:bicyclekick`, `:latest`
   - Create GitHub Release with auto-generated notes

### Release Naming Convention

Format: `v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}-{TERM}`

Example: `v1.0.0-assist`

- **Version**: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Term**: Football terminology from the alphabetical list above

### Docker Image Tags

Each release publishes three Docker tags:

```bash
# Pull by semantic version (recommended for production)
docker pull ghcr.io/nanotaboada/ts-node-samples-express-restful:1.0.0

# Pull by term name (memorable, useful for staging)
docker pull ghcr.io/nanotaboada/ts-node-samples-express-restful:assist

# Pull latest (development/testing only)
docker pull ghcr.io/nanotaboada/ts-node-samples-express-restful:latest
```

### Versioning Guidelines

**MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes to API contracts
**MINOR** (1.x.0): New features, backwards-compatible
**PATCH** (1.0.x): Bug fixes, no new features

### Important Notes

- 💡 Always update CHANGELOG.md `[Unreleased]` section as you work
- 🚫 Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- ✅ Test thoroughly before tagging
- 📝 Use clear, user-facing descriptions in CHANGELOG
- 🏷️ Tags trigger CD pipeline - CI only runs on push/PR
- 🐳 Only releases publish Docker images (not every merge)
