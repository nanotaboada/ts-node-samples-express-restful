# - Stage 1: Builder -----------------------------------------------------------

# This stage builds the application and its dependencies.
FROM node:jod-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency definition files first.
# This is a best practice to leverage Docker's layer caching.
# If these files don't change between builds, Docker can reuse the cached layer
# from the 'npm ci' step, which is often the most time-consuming.
COPY package.json package-lock.json tsconfig.json ./

# Install all dependencies, including development dependencies (e.g., @types).
# These are needed for the TypeScript compilation and Swagger docs generation.
RUN npm ci

# Copy the entire TypeScript source code into the builder image.
COPY src/ ./src/

# Build (transpile) the TypeScript code into JavaScript, generate Swagger docs,
# and then remove dev dependencies to reduce the size of the builder image.
RUN npm run build && \
    npm run swagger:docs && \
    npm prune --omit=dev

# - Stage 2: Runtime -----------------------------------------------------------

# This stage creates the final, minimal image to run the application.
